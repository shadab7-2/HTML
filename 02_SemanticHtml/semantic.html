<h1>What is Semantic HTML?</h1>
<!-- Semantic HTML means using HTML tags that describe the meaning and purpose of the content instead of using generic <div> everywhere.
    
“I use semantic HTML to make pages more accessible, search-engine friendly, and maintainable. It improves both user experience and developer experience.”

<h2>🧠 Important Semantic Tags (With Meaning</h2>
<!-- 
     | Tag                         | Meaning / Use                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `<header>`                  | Top intro section / logo / nav         |
| `<nav>`                     | Links or navigation menus              |
| `<main>`                    | Unique main content of the page        |
| `<section>`                 | Logical grouping of related content    |
| `<article>`                 | Independent content (blog, card, post) |
| `<aside>`                   | Sidebar / related info                 |
| `<footer>`                  | Copyright, bottom navigation           |
| `<figure>` / `<figcaption>` | Images with captions                   |
| `<time>`                    | Date/time info                         |
| `<address>`                 | Contact details                        |

These tags communicate what the content is, not just how it looks.-->

<h2>⭐ Why use Semantic HTML?</h2>
<!-- 
Makes your structure clear to browsers
Improves SEO (search engines understand the content)
Helps screen readers → better accessibility (A11Y)
Improves team collaboration and maintainability
Boosts React component structure (<Navbar>, <Footer>, etc.) -->

<h1>💼 Real-World Usage (In Projects)</h1>
<h2>1 React Components</h2>
<!-- Semantic tags help break UI into meaningful components: -->
function Layout() { return (
<main>
  <section>
    <article>Post</article>
  </section>
</main>
); }
<!--  -->
<h2>2. SEO</h2>
<!-- 
Search engines rely on structure to understand:--
What your page is about
What is the main content
What to rank -->

<h2>3. Accessibility</h2>
<!-- 
Screen readers navigate using landmarks:
"Navigation region"
"Main content"
"Footer region"
Semantic HTML = better accessibility automatically. -->

<h2>4. Performance & Code Quality</h2>
<!--
Clean, semantic markup reduces:
DOM nesting
Extra <div> bombs
CSS complexity -->

<h1>❓ Interview Questions & Sample Answers</h1>
<!-- 
1️⃣ What is Semantic HTML?
“Semantic HTML uses tags that describe the meaning of content — like <header>, <main>, <section>, <article> — instead of generic containers. It improves SEO, accessibility, and code readability.”

2️⃣ Why is Semantic HTML important for SEO?
“Search engines understand the structure better — they know where the main content is, what is a navigation, what is a blog article — which helps pages rank higher.”

3️⃣ Difference between <section> and <article>?
<section> = Groups related content

<article> = Self-contained content that could stand alone (blog post, news card)

4️⃣ How does Semantic HTML improve accessibility?
“Screen readers use semantic tags as landmarks. For example, <nav> tells assistive tech that this is a navigation region.”

5️⃣ How many <main> tags can a page have?
Only one, because it represents the primary content of the page.

6️⃣ When should you use <aside>?
For content indirectly related to the main content (ads, related posts, sidebars).

7️⃣ <div> vs Semantic Tags — when to use what?
Use <div> only when no semantic meaning is needed.
Use semantic tags when content has a purpose.

8️⃣ What is a “div soup”?
Overusing <div> everywhere with no structure — makes code unreadable and inaccessible.

9️⃣ Is <header> only used once?
No. You can have multiple headers, e.g., page header and section header.

🔟 What is the purpose of <figure> and <figcaption>?
To wrap media elements with a caption for proper semantics. -->
